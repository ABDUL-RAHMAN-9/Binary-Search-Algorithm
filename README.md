# Binary-Search-Algorithm
<p>
Binary Search Algorithm is a searching algorithm used in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. The idea of binary search is to use the information that the array is sorted and reduce the time complexity to O(log N).

## Program:

```
// C++ program to implement iterative Binary Search
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// An iterative binary search function.
int binarySearch(int arr[], int low, int high, int x)
{
    while (low <= high) {
        int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;

        // Check if x is present at mid
        if (arr[mid] == x)
            return mid;

        // If x greater, ignore left half
        if (arr[mid] < x)
            low = mid + 1;

        // If x is smaller, ignore right half
        else
            high = mid - 1;
    }

    // If we reach here, then element was not present
    return -1;
}

// Driver code
int main(void)
{
    int arr[] = { 2, 3, 4, 10, 40 };
    int x = 10;
    int n = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);
    int result = binarySearch(arr, 0, n - 1, x);
    if(result == -1) cout << "Element is not present in array";
    else cout << "Element is present at index " << result;
    return 0;
}

```

## Output

```
Element is present at index 3

```
